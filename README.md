# HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard 📊

## Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive **HR Attrition Dashboard** designed to help organizations understand why employees leave and identify patterns in workforce turnover. The dashboard provides data-driven insights into employee demographics, salary structures, and satisfaction levels.

## Key Insights & Features
The dashboard is divided into two main views:

### 1. General Analysis & Trends
* **Total Attrition:** Tracking the absolute number of employees who left (237).
* **Attrition Performance:** Current attrition rate at **16.12%**.
* **Demographic Breakdown:** Analyzing attrition by **Gender** (63% Male), **Marital Status** (51% Single), and **Department** (Research & Development has the highest count).
* **Satisfaction vs. Distance:** A line chart showing the correlation between distance from home and environment satisfaction.

### 2. Root Cause Exploration
* **Job Role Impact:** Identifying that **Laboratory Technicians** and **Sales Executives** have the highest turnover.
* **Salary Segmentation:** Clear evidence that **"Low Salary"** brackets experience the highest attrition.
* **Age Group Analysis:** Comparing attrition across Mature, Seasoned, Senior, and Young age groups.
* **Experience Levels:** Analyzing monthly income and attrition across experience levels (Junior to Senior Expert).

## Technical Stack
* **Tool:** Power BI / Excel
* **Data Cleaning:** Power Query (Transforming raw HR data, handling nulls, and grouping ages).
* **Data Modeling:** DAX (Calculated measures for Attrition Rate, Average Salary Hike, and Promotion Gap).
* **Visualization:** Donut charts, Stacked bar charts, KPI cards, and interactive slicers.
